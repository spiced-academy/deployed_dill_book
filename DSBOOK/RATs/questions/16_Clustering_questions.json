Visual inspection of clusters can also be helpful, especially after applying dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE for high-dimensional data. If the performance is not satisfactory, you can try different clustering algorithms, adjust the number of clusters (for algorithms like K-Means, using methods like the elbow method), or tune specific hyperparameters relevant to the clustering algorithm being used (such as eps and min_samples for DBSCAN, or n_clusters for K-Means).
